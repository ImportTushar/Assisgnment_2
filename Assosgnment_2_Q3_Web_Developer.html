    <br>    
    <p>Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network). <br>
        Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. <br>
        A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.<br>
        Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web sites: writing markup and coding. <br>
        Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make content changes easier and available with basic technical skills. <br>
        <hr>
        For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can consist of hundreds of people (Web developers) and follow standard methods like Agile methodologies while developing Web sites. <br>
        Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to related job positions such as a graphic designer or information systems technician. <br>
        Web development may be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department.<br>
        There are three kinds of Web developer specialization: front-end developer, back-end developer, and full-stack developer.<br>
        Front-end developers are responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user browser, while back-end developers deal with the servers.<br>
        Since the commercialization of the Web, the industry has boomed and has become one of the most used technologies ever.</p>
