    <br>    
    <p>Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites. <br>
        The different areas of web design include web graphic design; user interface design (UI design); authoring, including standardised code and proprietary software; user experience design (UX design); and search engine optimization. <br>
        Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the design process, although some designers will cover them all. <br>
        The term "web design" is normally used to describe the design process relating to the front-end (client side) design of a website including writing markup. <br>
        Web design partially overlaps web engineering in the broader scope of web development. <br>
        Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and be up to date with web accessibility guidelines.</p>
