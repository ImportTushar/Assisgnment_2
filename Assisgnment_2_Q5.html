            The application you build should be fast and provide an interactive browsing experience to users. <br>
            If users seek more information, the application must be able to quickly fetch and organize the  <br>
            information in an easy-to-view manner. Further, as your application grows in popularity, it should <br>
            scale well, without adding any performance overhead to the application ecosystem.

            <b>   What is a modern tech stack?</b>
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: medium; color: blue;">
            A modern tech stack has many more components, because of the increase in the number of <br>
            devices from which users can access applications and the huge volumes of events and data processing. <br>
            It might include tools for containerization, performance monitoring, business intelligence, event processing,<br>
            data lakes, cloud services, microservices, and analytics. <br>
            You should choose the technology stack you want to use based on your project needs and other factors, <br>
            which we will discuss later in this article.
            <br>
           <p style="text-align: center; font-size: medium; color: blueviolet;">
            One of the most popular and easiest examples of a technology stack is the MEAN stack.  <br>
            MEAN stands for MongoDB-Express-Angular-Node.js. You can replace Angular and use React, as in the <br>
            MERN stack, since React is becoming equally popular, especially for single page web <br>
            applications.

                <dd>
                    For most of the web applications, the choice of frontend remains similar. Modern web applications <br>
                    are based on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, or frameworks based on JS, like React, Vue, and <br>
                    Express.

               <b>HTML</b>
                <dd>
                    HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) defines the basic layout and structure of your pages. For <br>
                    example, the sections, bulleted points, and tables are created using HTML tags. <br>
                </dd>

                <b>CSS</b>
                 <dd>
                    The dynamic elements of the page come from the JavaScript code written by developers. For<br>
                    example, what happens when you hover your mouse over an image, or when you click on a submit,<br>
                    like, or comment button is decided by JavaScript events in the code. <br>
                    <br>
                    There are many other frameworks and libraries—like Bootstrap, Vue, React, Angular, and jQuery— <br>
                    that are built on JavaScript and provide additional functionalities and common use cases, making <br>
                    a developer's life much easier. <br>

                 <dd>
                    The backend or server-side tech stack consists of many components, like database, server, <br>
                    framework, and operating system. You have to choose the server-side frameworks and tools <br>
                    carefully, because some technologies are lightweight, fast, and suitable for basic purposes, <br>
                    whereas some are loaded with features that only a complex application might need. <br>
